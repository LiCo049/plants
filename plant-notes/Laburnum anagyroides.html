    <p class="w3-threequarter">Laburnum are small deciduous trees with leaves composed of three leaflets, and bright yellow pea-shaped flowers in pendent racemes</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">这棵落叶乔木属于观赏植物，五六月份开花，一串串的黄色，九十月份结果，果实像豆荚。英文名 Laburnum, 俗称 golden chain tree, 中文名毒豆。</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">毒豆全株有毒， 但是不会致死。中毒症状包括嗜睡激烈，呕吐，抽搐动作，昏迷，嘴角吐白沫，瞳孔放大等。在某些情况下，会严重腹泻，强直性惊厥。</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">槐树花是奶白淡黄色，羽状复叶。本篇的毒豆树，也叫做金链花树，花是艳丽的鲜黄色，叶子是三片一组(trifoliate), 看清这个就不会认错了。</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">Laburnum are deciduous trees native to southern Europe. There are two kinds – common laburnum (Laburnum anagyroides) and alpine laburnum (Laburnum alpinum). The trees have beautiful hanging yellow flowers in spring, which gives rise to their nickname ‘the golden chain tree’. The fruit develops into a dangling pod and its wood has historically been used in carpentry, including bagpipes at one stage. Laburnum are often planted as ornamental trees in gardens and parks, which is a significant factor in their notoriety.</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">All parts of the common laburnum are poisonous – the bark, roots, leaves and especially the seed pods. They contain the alkaloid toxin cytisine. Consumption of this can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, frothing at the mouth, convulsions and even death through paralysis.</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">The laburnum hysteria
It’s because these ornamental trees were often planted around gardens and school playgrounds that they started to cause panic. Children would play with and eat the seed pods, which look similar to regular peas. Many kids started to get sick as a result and in the 1970s, 3000 hospital admissions a year were put down to laburnum poisoning. But many of these were reactionary and the children’s stomachs were pumped before they could even be tested for poisoning or symptoms begin to show.
</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">But do we need to reach for an axe at the first sign of a chain tree? Many experts say this is an overreaction (and we often leave many more poisonous plants in their wake). If you’re worried about young children around laburnum, it’s best to chop off the lower branches so the kids can’t reach any dangling seed pods. You could also erect a fence around the base of the tree to keep stray hands at bay.</p>
