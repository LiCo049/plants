    <p class="w3-threequarter">Genus: Echinacea are erect, clump-forming rhizomatous perennials with simple or pinnately lobed leaves and solitary, long-stalked daisies with prominent conical central disks and often drooping ray florets; attractive to butterflies</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">Echinaceas have grown in popularity in recent years, thanks to the new trend for prairie-style planting. Known for their use in herbal medicine, these herbaceous perennials have pretty, daisy-like flowers with a central cone, hence their common name, coneflower. They’re easy to grow as they tolerate most soils (except very dry ones), and their sturdy stems mean that staking is unnecessary.</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">Echinacea purpurea, also known as purple coneflower, has pink flowers and a large, orange-brown cone in the centre. It’s perfect for growing in drifts towards the middle or back of a cottage-style or herbaceous border, or among grasses and rudbeckias in a prairie-style planting scheme. It’s resistant to adverse weather and doesn’t need staking. The flowers are long-lived, are excellent for cutting and are extremely attractive to pollinators. There are many cultivars of Echinacea purpurea available, ranging in height, flower colour and size of cone. They include the shorter, dark pink ‘Magnus’ and the short, pale pink ‘Mistra’.</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">Grow Echinacea purpurea in well-drained soil in full sun. Deadhead the flowers as they fade to encourage more to form, but in autumn leave the seedheads for the birds. Cut them back the following spring, when the new foliage emerges.</p>

    <p class="w3-threequarter">Growing Purple Coneflowers Purple coneflower plants grow best in poor or lean soil. Rich or heavily amended soil may
result in lush foliage and poor flowering. When planting purple coneflower, locate them in a full sun area. Full sun is
defined as at least six hours of sun each day. In more southern areas, morning sun may facilitate the best performance,
with late afternoon shade protecting the plants from burning. Purple coneflower plants may be started from seed or root
division.
</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">Seeds – If you wish to collect seeds for next year’s crop of purple coneflower plants, do so before the birds have eaten
all the seeds. Place a brown paper bag over the seed head, turn right side up and let seeds drop into the bag.
Professional growers believe stratification (chilling) of the seeds for a few weeks, after they are planted in moist
soil, produces a more abundant bloom when growing purple coneflowers. Those in areas where temperatures remain warm year
long may want to try this technique. Alternately, planting purple coneflower seeds in autumn, in areas with cold
winters, allows the seeds to chill naturally. Division – Purple coneflower plants may be started from root division in
fall. Only plants that have been in the ground for three years or longer should be divided. Younger coneflower plants
may not have developed a root system that is extensive enough for division. Root division should be limited to every
three to four years.
