<p>Polychroma is an amazing Euphorbia variety which produces bright yellow flowers against a back-drop of contrasting
    dark green foliage. Euphorbia polychroma's green-tinged yellow blends easily with a range of colours. Yellow and
    blue are complementary colours, so the effect is striking. Bluebells, scillas, pulmonarias are the obvious
    combination. This is an easy plant to grow, and it is pleasingly long-lived. It performs best in full sun, but does
    well enough in a little shade. It's compact shrubby habit makes it ideal for garden borders or patio containers.
    Height and spread 40cm. Flowers May to June. 9cm pot grown plants supplied.

<p>Bring pizzazz to your garden pots or borders with this showy hardy perennial. Fashionable foliage in spring produces
    a cushion-like mound, topped with vibrant yellow-green flowers, creating a striking contrast to neighbouring plants.
    Try planting alongside blue-foliaged or blue-flowered plants for the dream planting scheme.
