Here's a plant that will stand out from the crowd in your garden - the first ever deciduous bicolour Agapanthus. This African lily is robust, and truly hardy in the UK meaning it's perfect in the garden border as well as in a patio container. The flowers of Agapanthus 'Twister' are absolutely glorious, with crystal white flutes turning inky blue at the base. The huge globes of colour appear from mid to late summer, hosted on strong, sturdy stems that need no staking. Height: 60cm (24"). Spread: 50cm (20").

   <li> Eye-catching and unique! A striking colour combination rarely seen in African lilies.
   <li> Stunning blooms of pristine white and violet-blue explode like a floral firework display.
<li>    This African lily deserves a prime location as its glorious trumpet blooms demand attention.
   <li> Easy-to-grow, great for cut flowers and a garden 'must-have' - even in the smallest of spaces.
<li>    Supplied as an established plant in a 9cm pot - stock is limited, so don't miss out!
