You can remove the single female flowers to encourage more of the large double male flowers to be produced 
if you wish - although we like to leave them on for a fuller display.

Deadhead faded blooms to extend the flowering period.

Care Information

Planting Advice for your Begonia:

    Begonia tubers will start into growth from February onwards. The easiest way is to put them into shallow 
    tray with a good quality compost which has been moistened.
    Plant the tubers with the domed side downwards and the hollow uppermost. Shoots will start to emerge 
    depending on temperature. We recommend that you start them off in a warm room.
    As soon as the shoots of the tubers are about 2cm (1in) long pot them up in 15cm (4in) pots. As soon as 
    the roots reach the sides of the pot, they're ready to go into containers. Alternatively, you can plant 
    the tubers straight into baskets and tubs where they are to flower.
    When all risk of frost has passed, acclimatise begonia plants to outdoor conditions over a period of 7 to 10 
    days. Choose a sunny or semi shaded position that is protected from strong winds - a cold frame is ideal.
    Grow on in full sun or partial shaded areas. The sunnier the site, the more vibrant the colours will be.


Aftercare Advice for Begonias:

    For best results keep plants well-watered, and feed once every two weeks with a high potassium feed while in
     flower, and deadhead regularly to encourage further flowers.
    Water regularly during the summer - begonias thrive in moist soil. Take care not to over-water, as this will 
    cause new begonia flower buds to drop.
    Deadhead the single female flowers to encourage more of the large double male flowers to be produced and to 
    extend the flowering period.
