Magnolias are a traditional sign that spring has arrived each and every year, with their beautiful huge buds bursting into colour early in the season. Most Magnolia are pink or shades thereof, so this rare and fabulously unique hybrid ’Yellow Bird’ really is unusual, and made even more so as it has been grafted to make a half standard lollipop form with a clear stem beneath!
<p>
Magnolia ‘Yellow Bird’ bears the most wonderful huge lemon-yellow flowers, sometimes streaked lime green, emerging just before the deep green leaves unfurl in the spring.
<p>
Easy to grow, it’s already been grafted into a half standard form with a ball of foliage atop a long clear stem, hardy to -15C (although best to avoid windy sites) and with just a little prune to shape will form a nice, low maintenance, medium sized specimen garden tree.
<p>
Plant up in a large patio container and place by a doorway, gateway or pathway where it will make a superb eye-catching feature, or on a patio where you can really enjoy the beauty.
<p>
Supplied as a bare root tree approx 70-80cm tall, ready for immediate planting.
