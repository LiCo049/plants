    <p class="w3-threequarter">Use small containers, so the plants remain quite tight – clear plastic pots work well and
      allow the green roots to photosynthesise. Use a light, free-draining, open compost containing pumice or charcoal
      (specialist orchid composts are available). It’s quite natural for the roots to come out of their pot, but be
      careful not to snap them off when repotting.</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">Moth orchids are epiphytic plants meaning that in the wild they grow on the surface of
      other plants, rather than in the soil. So while they need humidity, they don’t do well when overwatered.</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">Water once every week or two, with rainwater if possible, or boiled and cooled tap water.
      Use either specialist orchid fertiliser or a dilution of other house plant food every couple of weeks.</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">After flowering, cut back the flower spike to just above the first node. Your moth orchid
      should produce a new flower spike from this point.</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">You can repot your moth orchid after flowering, but this isn’t essential. However, always
      wait until flowering has finished, as disturbing the roots will cause the plants to drop flowers.</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter"></p>

      Can refer to either home-made garden compost or seed/potting compost:• Garden compost is a soil improver made from
      decomposed plant waste, usually in a compost bin or heap. It is added to soil to improve its fertility, structure
      and water-holding capacity. • Seed or potting composts are used for growing seedlings or plants in containers – a
      wide range of commercially produced composts are available, made from a mix of various ingredients, such as loam,
      coir, peat, sand and fertiliser, although you can mix your own.
      compost, mainly made of composted bark. Keeping the roots in good condition – not too wet or too dry – is the key
      to success with moth orchids.</p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">Water moth orchids weekly throughout the growing season, but reduce watering slightly in
      winter. Never let the roots dry out completely and never let plants sit in water. Always let excess water drain
      away. Ideally use tepid water, preferably rainwater. When watering, take care not to splash the leaves or get
      water into the crown (The crown is usually at the base of herbaceous plants, often identified by buds at ground
      level, usually where the roots and stems join at soil level. See plants such as rhubarb, chrysanthemum or
      Hylotelephium (sedum). 2) A crown can refer to the branches on a tree located at the top of a trunk, for example
      the canopy of an oak. crown), although you can mist the plant lightly in summer to increase humidity. </p>
    <p class="w3-threequarter">Water moth orchids lightly, about once a week. Water from above and tip out any water
      that collects in the saucer. Alternatively, hold the container under a gently running tap, being careful not to
      wet the leaves, or stand it in a bowl of water, then allow to drain thoroughly.</p>
