Loved by butterflies & bees
<p>An enchanting mixture of colourful blooms with bright yellow centres, produced all through summer over neat, dwarf plants with rich, bright green foliage. Adored by bees and other pollinators. Ideal for pots, tubs, borders and beds.

<p>Height: 60cm/24in 
<p>Plant Class: Half Hardy Perennial (Treat as HHA).
<p>Habit: Medium.

<p>Sow indoors, February-April. A warm kitchen windowsill is all you need for starting these seeds. Sow, 0.5cm (¼") deep, in trays of compost. Water well and place in a warm position. A temperature of 15-20°C (60-68°F) is ideal. Keep moist. Seedlings usually appear in 14-28 days. Transplant them, 5cm (2") apart, to other trays when large enough to handle (always hold by a leaf, never by the stem). Grow on in cooler, but not cold conditions. Gradually accustom young plants to outside conditions (avoid frosts), before planting out, May-June, 30cm (1') apart, into well-drained soil, when frosts are over. Flowers: July-October.
