          succulent and not Cacti. It's common named is derived from the horizontal Zebra looking stripes. These differ

        </p>

        <p> Native to South Africa, these clump forming succulent plants have similarities with the Aloe plant and
          they're related with the same sub-family. There are also sub-species grown.
        </p>

        <p> In their natural habitat (sub-tropical) they receive plenty of sun and periods without rainfall. Their
          succulent nature enables them to store water within the thick leaves when there's no frequent rainfall.</p>


        <p> The main difference between the two species (H. fasciata - H. attenuata) is the Haworthia fasciata has
          smoother inner leaves unlike the H. attenuata that displays tubercles (warty growths). The Fasciata is
          supposedly more rarer than the Attenuata and seems to have fatter leaves.
        </p>


        <p>Primarily they are grown in gardens. However, they are also grown in greenhouses, conservatories and within
          homes.
        </p>





        <p><b>Flowering:</b> If the Hawothhia blooms appear (may not indoors) they are small tubular white or pink
          flowers growing from an inflorescence (thin kind of stem).
        </p>

        <p><b>Foliage:</b> The Zebra Haworthia forms a rosette of leaves. These leaves are very thick and patterned with
          Zebra like white stripes or tubercles that look like warts. They're a clump forming plant in the wild so they
          can be grown with several or as many as you like in one container.

                These are propagated in the same way as Aloe plants. Propagate with a couple of inches of leaves,

                (offsets) that can be removed from the mother plant and replanted. Either method you should water the
                soil once and then wait to see a small sign of new growth to prevent killing them with overwatering.
