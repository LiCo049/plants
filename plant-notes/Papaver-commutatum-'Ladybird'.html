         Papaver commutatum ‘Ladybird’ is a gorgeous annual poppy, bearing large red flowers with black splodges,
         reminiscent of a ladybird. It’s ideal for using to fill gaps in a sunny border and is extremely attractive to
         bees. It makes an excellent cut flower.

            For best results, grow Papaver commutatum ‘Ladybird’ in moist but well-drained soil, in full sun. If given
            the right conditions, it will self-seed around the garden. Alternatively, sow fresh seed each spring – it’s
            incredibly easy to grow, simply scatter seed where you want it to grow.
