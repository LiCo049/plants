Akebia quinata is an unusual climber, best grown in warmer gardens since the flowers are prone to damage from late frosts. The maroon-chocolate flowers look almost artificial, with three thick, waxy ‘petals’ forming an inverted cup shape. These are clustered along the stems and have an exotic spicy fragrance with a hint of vanilla. They stand out against a background of light purple, three-lobed leaves, most colourful in full sun. In mild conditions the leaves last all winter but in cold areas expect them to be shed. After a particularly warm summer, large sausage-shaped fruit dangle enticingly from the stems.

Grow Akebia quinata in moist but well-drained soil in full sun or partial shade, ideally with some shelter provided. Alternatively grow it in a conservatory or greenhouse.
