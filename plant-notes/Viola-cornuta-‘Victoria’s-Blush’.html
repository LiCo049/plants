Violas tend to have smaller flowers than closely related pansies, and are usually more tolerant of summer heat. Like pansies, violas are used in bedding displays, hanging baskets and patio containers, and work well when grown with spring-flowering bulbs. The flowers of many species are edible and may be eaten in salads.

Viola ‘Victoria’s Blush’ is a well-established variety, bearing flowers in a clean refreshing shade of bright blue. It makes a good ground-cover plant and is well suited to growing in containers, hanging baskets and bedding displays at the front of the border.
