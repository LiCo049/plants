<p>    A compact, shade-loving, spreading euphorbia that has long-lasting, lime-green flowers in late spring above rosettes of glossy, dark green leaves. It's a valuable plant for difficult areas of dry shade, particularly under trees, and it also looks at home in a woodland setting. As it is evergreen and suckering it also makes attractive groundcover. Left unchecked it can become invasive, romping through areas of a small garden.

 <p>    Garden care: In autumn cut back the faded flower stems, avoiding new ones. When working with spurges always wear gloves since the milky sap is poisonous and a potential skin irritant. Remove unwanted seedlings each spring as part of routine border maintenance

 <p>    CAUTION toxic if eaten/skin & eye irritant
