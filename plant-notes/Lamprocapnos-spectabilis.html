Formerly known as Dicentra spectablilis, bleeding heart, Lamprocapnos spectabilis, is a Chinese plant bearing pink-red, heart-shaped flowers with white tips, which hang from arching flower stems in late spring to early summer. Although it grows in light shade and looks good growing in clumps amongst shrubs, it often does even better in a sunny border, provided the soil stays sufficiently moist.
<p>
Clumps of Lamprocapnos spectabilis remain compact for many years and do not need dividing, fortunately, because they have brittle roots and do not like disturbance – instead, try taking root cuttings in spring. The Royal Horticultural Society has given it its prestigious Award of Garden Merit (AGM).
