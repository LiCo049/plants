Growing Purple Coneflowers Purple coneflower plants grow best in poor or lean soil. Rich or heavily amended soil may
result in lush foliage and poor flowering. When planting purple coneflower, locate them in a full sun area. Full sun is
defined as at least six hours of sun each day. In more southern areas, morning sun may facilitate the best performance,
with late afternoon shade protecting the plants from burning. Purple coneflower plants may be started from seed or root
division:

Seeds – If you wish to collect seeds for next year’s crop of purple coneflower plants, do so before the birds have eaten
all the seeds. Place a brown paper bag over the seed head, turn right side up and let seeds drop into the bag.
Professional growers believe stratification (chilling) of the seeds for a few weeks, after they are planted in moist
soil, produces a more abundant bloom when growing purple coneflowers. Those in areas where temperatures remain warm year
long may want to try this technique. Alternately, planting purple coneflower seeds in autumn, in areas with cold
winters, allows the seeds to chill naturally. Division – Purple coneflower plants may be started from root division in
fall. Only plants that have been in the ground for three years or longer should be divided. Younger coneflower plants
may not have developed a root system that is extensive enough for division. Root division should be limited to every
three to four years.
