    <p class="twothird">
      Christmas cacti (Schlumbergera) flower over the Christmas period, from late November to January – hence their
      name. They make good Christmas gifts – their bright, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, white, pink, purple
      and even yellow bring a welcome splash of colour to any room. Their flat, segmented and trailing stems look
      attractive all year round.
    </p>
    <p class="twothird">
      Re-pot once a year (or at least every two years) to maintain healthy growth. This can be done at the end of March,
      which is the beginning of their growing season. Use a standard cactus compost or a loam based compost such as John
      Innes No 2 with added leafmould (or peat substitute) and grit to help improve the drainage. When potting on,
      choose only a slightly larger container as they like to be snug in a small pot.
    </p>
    <p class="twothird">

      You’ll find Christmas cactus plants in garden centres or supermarkets during the holiday period, but for the
      widest range of varieties, its best to buy from specialist retailers online.
    </p>
    <p class="twothird">

      Schlumbergera are forest cacti – in the wild, they grow in tropical rainforests, where they grow attached to
      trees. This means that need different growing conditions to desert cacti. They need to be kept away from bright
      sunlight and like plenty of humidity.
    </p>
    <p class="twothird">

      Christmas cacti will flower every year given the right treatment – the main thing to remember is that they need
      two periods of rest (in a cool room, with less watering): one after flowering and another in autumn. The plants
      can last for years and are often handed down through generations.
    </p>
    <p class="twothird">


      Grow your Christmas cactus in a warm, bright spot out of direct sunshine, and mist a few times a week. In order to
      flower every year, Schlumbergera need two periods of ‘rest’ – lower temperatures and less watering – after
      flowering in late winter and again in September.
