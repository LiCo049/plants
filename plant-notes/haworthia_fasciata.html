Geranium robertianum, (syn. Robertiella robertiana) commonly known as Herb-Robert,[1] Red Robin, Death come quickly, Storksbill, Dove's Foot, Crow's Foot, or (in North America) Robert Geranium, is a common species of cranesbill native to Europe and parts of Asia, North America, and North Africa.

Description
It grows as a procumbent to erect annual or biennial plant, up to 50cm high, producing small, pink, five-petalled flowers (8-14 mm in diameter)[2] from April until the autumn. The leaves are deeply dissected, ternate to palmate,[2][3] and the stems often reddish; the leaves also turn red at the end of the flowering season. The plant has little root structure.[citation needed]

Distribution
Its main area of distribution is Europe from the north Mediterranean coast to the Baltic and from the British Isles in the west to the Caucasus in the east.[4] It has been introduced into many other temperate parts of the world, probably through its use as an ornamental plant, such as in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. In the state of Washington, it is known as Stinky Bob and classified as a noxious weed.(WSNWCB 2005, p. 8)(WSNWCB 2007)

Geranium robertianum is common throughout Great Britain and Ireland in woodland, hedgerows, scree and maritime shingle.[2] It grows at altitudes from sea level to 710 metres (2,329 ft) in Teesdale, England and above 2,100 metres (6,890 ft) in parts of mainland Europe on calcareous alpine screes.[5]

Uses
In traditional herbalism, Herb Robert was used as a remedy for toothache and nosebleeds[6] and as a vulnerary (used for or useful in healing wounds.) [7] Freshly picked leaves have an odor resembling burning tires when crushed, and if they are rubbed on the body the smell is said to repel mosquitoes.[7] The active ingredients are tannins, a bitter compound called geraniin, and essential oils. It was carried to attract good luck, and due to its analogical association with storks, to enhance fertility.[citation needed]
