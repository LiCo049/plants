<p> An attractive collection of Pelargonium, they are sure to add a splash of colour to your summer display. Upright in habit they make excellent plants for the front of borders, containers and hanging baskets. The pretty blooms stand on strong, sturdy stems that sit atop the lush green foliage from June-October. They will require little maintenance, just the occasional trimming of the flower heads when they die off. This will then encourage more blooms to follow. Height 35-45cm. Spread 30-35cm. The collection of six inlcudes three each of Red and white and white, order a pack of 12 for six of each colour. UK-grown 3cm jumbo plug plants supplied.
