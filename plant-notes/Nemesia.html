Grow nemesias for summer displays in pots, as well as beds that have good drainage. Buy nemesias as plug plants in early spring or as garden ready plants in late spring to summer. Some nemesias can be raised from seed. Plant in a sunny spot after the frosts in well-drained soil. Deadhead to encourage more blooms. If you want to keep your perennial nemesias to flower the following year, move them to a frost-free spot to overwinter.
