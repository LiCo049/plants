      <pre>    Sumptuous, colour-changing, semi-double flowers will bring an opulent show of magnificence to any garden.
    Gradually transitioning from salmon-pink to a subtle pastel orange-cream, the opulent show of blousy blooms really must be seen to be believed!
    Superb as a garden plant and perfect as a cut flower, the buds stay tight for days before opening up into goblets of pure joy, adding spectacular drama to a vase or hand-tied bouquet - a florist's dream!
    Coral Sunset certainly lives up to its name, with the cupped blooms topping 8in across and going through a series of subtle colour changes as they mature.
    Supplied as a premium bare root with 2-3 buds, ready for planting out or potting up.


    Despite the myths that surround them, peonies are easy to grow.
    As a hardy perennial, the plant dies back to below ground level each year in autumn, then fresh new growth appears again in spring. Dead stems can be removed in late autumn.
    Ideally, plant in the autumn while the ground is still warm or in the spring as it warms up. Plant in full sun or light shade in heavy, well-draining, fertile soil. There’s no need to add additional compost unless your soil is really poor.
    Dig a planting hole large enough to spread out roots without bending them. Set crown with buds 3-5cm (1-2in) below ground-level. Backfill and water in thoroughly.
    Peonies can tolerate drought quite well but they need plenty of water if they are to flower well.
    Plant your peonies in soil that drains well. Clay is fine as long as it doesn't stay wet.
    Mulch lightly with well-rotted manure every spring - although not too deep as this will bury the crown. At the same time, apply a balanced slow-release fertiliser around the base of the plant.
    If you want really big flowers, de-bud the side shoots in April/May with a sharp knife. Remove spent flower heads after blooming to keep your peony pretty all summer long.
    The flower stems may not be strong enough to keep the often-heavy flamboyant flowers upright and staking is often required.
    Peonies seldom need to be divided or moved, but if necessary it should be carried out only in the autumn.
