此花的名字真是得来全不费功夫，因为是我们在花卉中心指名买的。三色堇有很多别名：比如三色紫罗兰、猫儿脸、蝴蝶花、人面花、猫脸花、阳蝶花、鬼脸花等。Pansy做为英语俚语还可以形容男人娘娘腔，同性恋，非常唐突无礼的用法。所以如果送花给男人，别送这个！
<p>
三色堇是小株植物，大约20厘米高，属于一年生或短期多年生草本植物。三色堇开花较早，和春季开花的球茎植物 - 比如郁金香，水仙等 - 差不多一个时间。英文名Pansy来自法语pensie, 代表思念，想念。三色堇的花朵很好辨认，五片圆花瓣，四片朝上一片朝下。三色堇的近亲紫罗兰（violets）也是五片花瓣，三片花瓣朝上，两片朝下。花朵较小，气味比三色堇浓郁。
<p>
三色堇的花朵大致有三种模式。
<li>1.	盛开的花朵是单一颜色的比如黄色，蓝色。
<li>2.	花朵颜色单一，中间有散发状黑线。
<li>3.	花朵上的花纹呈现脸状。我家的就是这种，也是三色堇中最普遍的。
<p>
三色堇有一种特殊的香味，尤其是黄色和蓝色的花，早晚比其他时间浓郁。
<p>
三色堇是非常容易打理的植物，病虫害不多，一周浇两次水就好了。
<p>三色堇的花和叶富含维生素A和C,可以食用。花朵也可以制作糖浆，沙拉，甚至染料。
<p>
三色堇和爱情关系太大了，花语代表思念，思慕，不同颜色也有不同含义。三色堇的花朵曾经被用来制作love potion(爱情药水？)英文不错的同学可以看看文后链接，有关三色堇的传说和历史故事很有趣的。

The three colours of the original pansy, purple, white and yellow, were thought to symbolize memories, loving thoughts, and souvenirs — all things that ease the hearts of separated lovers. The three petals were thought to be representative of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, and thus the flower was sometimes called herb trinity.
<p>
In German and Scottish folktales, pansies were called stepmother: the large lower petal is the mother, the two large petals to either side of her are the well-dressed daughters, and the two small upper petals are poor stepdaughters.
<p>
In another German story, the pansy at one time had a wonderfully strong, sweet scent. People would travel from miles around to smell this scent. In doing so, however, they would trample down the grasses surrounding the pansy. Because this ruined the feed for cattle, the pansy prayed to God for help. God gave the plant great beauty but took away the scent.
<p>
According to the doctrine of signatures, pansy leaves, which are heart shaped, were used to cure a broken heart.
<p>
Pansies were used to foretell the future for King Arthur’s Knights of the Round Table. Plucking a pansy petal, the knights would look for secret signs. If the petal had four lines, this meant hope. If the lines were thick and leaned toward the left, this meant a life of trouble. Lines leaning toward the right signified prosperity until the end. Seven lines meant constancy in love (and if the center streak were the longest, Sunday would be the wedding day). Eight streaks meant fickleness, nine meant a changing of heart, and eleven signified disappointment in love and an early grave.
