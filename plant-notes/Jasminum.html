<p>
    Jasmines are evergreen or deciduous climbers with twining stems. They can be summer or winter flowering, with
    flowers that are white, yellow and occasionally red and pink.
<p>
    All jasmines have small star-shaped flowers with a sweet and distinctive fragrance. Some are tender and only
    suitable for growing in a conservatory or greenhouse but the hardier varieties are perfect for greening up a wall or
    fence, provided they have wires to support them. Plant jasmine somewhere sunny, warm and sheltered, preferably near
    a seating area to enjoy the scent of the flowers.
<p>
    Jasmine is renowned for its fragrance. There are various forms, including scented summer-flowering climbers for a
    sheltered spot, and tender plants that will fill your home with floral perfume. Hardy winter jasmine has yellow
    blooms which, although unscented, bring valuable colour to the garden when little else is brave enough to flower.
