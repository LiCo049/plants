    Lavender Perfection is a stunning variety of decorative dahlia. Decorative dahlias have double flowers with slightly flat petals and no central disk for pollinators. Lavender Perfection has beautiful lavender-pink flowers with large flat petals that are lightly quilled at the tip, and can measure up to 15cm in diameter Suitable for growing in gardens and containers if well staked and perfect for cut flowers. Grows up to 1m tall 1 tuber per pack
    In general, dahlias like to be planted around 2" deep in rich, well-drained soil, full sun. They should be cut to near ground level in mid-autumn amd gardeners in colder areas should be mindful to lift their tubers and replant them in late spring after any chance of frost has passed, while those in milder areas with well-drained soil may simply leave their tubers in the ground and protect with a deep mulch.
